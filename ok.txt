Problem 1: Optimized Subscription Management API

Objective: Create a RESTful API using Python (Flask) backed by SQL (SQLite or MySQL/MariaDB) for managing user subscriptions. Your focus should be on optimizing SQL queries for efficiency and scalability.

Requirements:

User Registration and Authentication:

Endpoints for registering new users and authenticating them.

Subscription Plans:

Create and list subscription plans (e.g., Free, Basic, Pro).

User Subscriptions:

Allow users to subscribe, upgrade, and cancel subscriptions.

Optimize queries for retrieving active subscriptions efficiently.

Performance Optimization:

Optimize database queries for listing subscriptions and retrieving subscription history.

Ensure indexes are properly used to speed up lookups.

Analyze slow queries and provide an explanation of your optimizations.

Constraints:

Use SQLAlchemy ORM but override default queries with raw SQL where needed for optimization.

Include clear documentation and comments explaining query optimizations.

Provide basic tests for subscription handling and query performance.

Submission:

Provide your submission via a GitHub repository.

Include setup instructions (Docker or virtual environment).

Include a short document explaining your optimization choices.
